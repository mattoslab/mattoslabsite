# J's Notes

git = a popular control system...for tracking edits on code

- git clone https://github.com/mattoslab/mattoslabsite.git
- git status (what was modified)
- git diff (to see what was changed from previous version)
- type q to exit
- command space “terminal”

Markdown (markup is what it is doing)
- dashes make bullets
- \# signs define size of headers
- \* before and after make italics
- \** star before and after make bold

YAML - yet another markup language
- An easy readable way to define simple structured data
has  a .ymL ending
- dash defines list
- \| means preserve new line
- \> means do not preserve lines

Command Line
- cd /Users/Dante2/Documents/mattoslabsite
(this gets me to the code directory)
- ls lists what’s in the folder
- open . means open this in the finder or on the Mac

Atom is the text edit program
- don't forget control/shift/m to get the window to the right to look OK
